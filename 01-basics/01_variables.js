const accountId =144553
let accountEmail = "aishwarycherupally1@gmail.com"
var accountPassword ="12345"
accountCity ="jaipur"
// accountId = 2 not allowed
// so here constant declare means only one way but while declaring variable we can use let and var and var is not that used because of scope and scope means { } and issues in block scope and functional scope used in for and if etc sooooooooo so use const and let 
/*
*/
accountEmail ="kju@nic.com"
accountCity ="banglore"
let accountState ;
// use ; or not your wish
// console.log(accountId);
console.log([accountId , accountEmail, accountPassword, accountCity]);

// console.log(accountEmail); it is kind of old so use table to print all like see down
console.table([accountId , accountEmail, accountPassword, accountCity , accountState]);
